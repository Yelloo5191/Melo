# MELO

### The solution to your lyrical problems.

Melo is a music discovery platform that helps you find new music based on your listening habits.

By authenticating with Spotify, Melo can do it's job by taking into account your top listening activity based on the past three months, and using that to seed Spotify's recommendations feature. 
Melo then provides the user with two main pages, the Dashboard and Generator. The former of the two presents the user with a table of recommended music, a chart of the user's top tracks, and
a list of the user's recently played songs; Whereas the latter provides the user with a tool for generating custom mood-based playlists that are again, influenced by the user's activity.
